# What's New in v1.4.0 ✨

A whirlwind tour of everything that landed in v1.4.0 — across the
**LegendaryMissions** content and the **sbs_utils** library that powers it. Links
go to the relevant docs.

---

## 🛩️ Hangar

- **Sortie board.** Fighter and shuttle pilots pick their own missions from a board.
- **Loadouts as upgrades.** Craft loadouts are now deltas over the ship hull —
  shields and ammo applied through the item/upgrade system — with an image-based
  cockpit overlay.

See the [LegendaryMissions addon reference](legendarymissions/addons/index.md).

## 🧭 Quests & Stories

- **A signal-driven quest engine** with kill / collect / scan / dock / reach /
  arrive triggers and real rewards — all **authored in simple AMD files**.
- **A proper Quest Log** you can accept and abandon quests from.
- **Multi-step bridge stories** that unfold a step at a time.

Docs: [Quests](build/quests.md).

## 💱 Items & Upgrades

- **Discoverable items and upgrades** driven by a data registry — collect them in
  space and activate them through a generic **Upgrades GUI**.

Docs: [Items & Upgrades](build/items-upgrades.md).

## 🌐 Web pages, written in MAST

- Author browser pages with `//web/<path>` routes using the same `gui_*` layout you
  already know, and open them in a browser while a mission runs — **live** pages
  that update in place and are parameterized by the URL query (`/web/scores?title=Hi`).
- **Living pages** (leaderboards, dashboards) update during the game and are kept as
  a snapshot for after it.
- Bake a read-only page to a **standalone HTML** file, front **many engines from one
  address** (`/web/<engine>/…`), or run it from a non-engine MAST tool — all with
  **no engine changes**.

Docs: [Web pages](build/web-pages.md) · [Serving web pages](tooling/web-proxy.md).

## 🛡️ The Siege Map, Refined

- **Pick your battlefield size** with a new **Map Size** option.
- **Consistent, repeatable maps** from phased, keyed seeding (no more surprise
  spawns inside an asteroid).
- **Share the exact setup** with per-map **seed options** and a **shareable game
  code**.
- **Optional bonus objectives** for skilled crews.

Playing & hosting: [LegendaryMissions](legendarymissions/index.md).

## 🎬 Quality-of-Life & Presentation

- **The Director console** (formerly Console View) — pair and rotate multiple
  views, with a cinematic mode for the big screen.
- **Game results** are saved after every game — a rolling history of outcomes.
- **Shareable game codes** and per-map seed options so crews can replay the exact
  same setup.

Details: [LegendaryMissions &rsaquo; Game features](legendarymissions/playing/features.md).

## 🛠️ For Mission Makers & Tinkerers

- **Run missions outside Cosmos.** A full **headless test mode** plays a mission
  for N seconds and reports a pass/fail verdict with coverage — great for CI — plus
  a browser-based **mock GUI** with a 3D cinematic view and 2D radar.
  → [Testing missions](tooling/testing.md)
- **Web pages, written in MAST** — see above. → [Web pages](build/web-pages.md)
- **A coverage "exerciser"** that drives real gameplay (scans, torpedoes, docking,
  comms) to shake out routes automatically. → [Testing missions](tooling/testing.md)
- **A faithful mock simulation** calibrated to the real engine: ship speeds, 3D
  steering, per-facing shields, heat, energy, and a full weapons model (beams,
  torpedoes, drones, mines, EMP). → [Testing missions](tooling/testing.md)
- **`--use-working-tree`** to smoke-test local library edits, and **`--seed`** for
  reproducible runs. → [The `sbs` CLI](tooling/cli.md)
- **`signal_next`** — one-shot await of the next signal. → [Signals](api/procedural/signal.md)
- **An Artemis 2.8 → Cosmos porting-comfort layer** to ease bringing older content
  forward. → [Porting from Artemis 2.x](mast/porting-2x.md)
- **A faster, friendlier MAST compiler** — quicker parsing, *all* errors reported at
  once, sturdier crash handling, and more Python built-ins available in scripts.
  → [The MAST language](mast/overview.md)
- **Deterministic building blocks** — keyed terrain fields, position-keyed
  [scatter](api/utility/scatter.md), and reusable game-code encode/decode.

*Thanks for playing, building, and tinkering. There's more under the hood than ever
— go build something great.* 🚀
